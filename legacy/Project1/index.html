				With the NAU semester back in full swing, what can you, as a citizen of beautiful Flagstaff, AZ, expect? <br />
			We asked long time resident and friend of the station, John Doe, for his thoughts. <br />
				<blockquote>
					"Well frankly it's the same as every other year. <br />
					The streets, mostly Milton and the 66, <b> become congested beyond all imagination, </b>"
				</blockquote>
			We asked Mr. Doe which streets he would recommend avoiding at all costs, to which he answered:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xWKGLhJJb6J2"> S Milton Rd. </a></li>
					<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9F3V8H7tHNs"> Route 66 (particularly Downtown)</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PkjJhyKABds"> Butler Ave. </a></li>
					<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QKqAr8KSvfp"> S Lone Tree Rd.</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EVCvXdAkMF82"> S Knoles Dr. </a></li>
				</ul>
			<i>Project 1 News</i> would like to remind everyone to be careful on the roads and to practice safe driving methods. <br />
			For all the returning students, do keep in mind the heightened elevation and its effects on the body.
