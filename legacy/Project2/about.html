			Hello! This is Jesus Garcia's personal Webspace <br />
			That is a picture of Bullhead City, AZ, my hometown. <br />
			I was born on July 30th, 1996. <br />
			I'm currently enrolled at Northern Arizona University <br />
			And am currently in my Junior Year of the Computer Science Bachelor's degree program. <br />
			I currently have a 3.6 GPA but this may change as this semester is quite challenging already! <br /> <br />
